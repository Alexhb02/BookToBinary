# BookToBinary

This program was designed to take in a large text file (like a book) in order generate a binary association with every character in the book based on their frequency. The program outputs a new textfile of the original inputted text translated to binary as well as a textfile showing the translation between characters and binary numbers along with their frequency in the text file.

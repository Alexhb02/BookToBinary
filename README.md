# BookToBinary

This program was designed to take in a large text file (like a book) in order to generate a binary association with every character in the book based on their respective frequency. The program outputs a binary translation of the original textfile, as well as a textfile showing the correspondence between characters and binary numbers and with their frequency in the text file.
